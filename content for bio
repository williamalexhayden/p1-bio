#bio
Truth Betold Creations is lead by William Hayden, with assistance from his friends at Phinese Graphix.  At TB Creations, the goal is always to preach a truth filled message based off the content given and the clients ambitions. Since 2013, we have gained experience in a multitude of mediums including album design, logo's, packaging, illustrations, video editing, web design and sound design.

Our interests include things like music, hockey, movies and more. The depth of interesting content found in products is what really pulls William in, and it shows in Truth Betold Projects work.
